## BIOS
- Press Del to enter the BIOS. Use latest available bios for this board which F5d as of this writing.
- Enable XMP Profile1.
- Disable Legacy USB.
- Enable Internal graphics and set DVMT Pre-Allocated to 128MB, Total GFix memory to MAX.
- The rest of the settings can be left at their defaults. Make sure though that CFG Lock is disabled and CSM Support is disabled.

## Installation issue
I could not install macOS on this board the normal way. I was getting a boot loop after the second reboot during the install process.
What I finally did was to install the macOS on an external USB SSD enclosure on anther hackintosh. After OS was fully installed, I popped the SSD into my new system and was able to boot successfully.

## USB issue
Because XhciPortLimit kernel quirk no longer works on the latest Big Sur 11.3.x, we are left with 15 ports max. I have made a custom USBPorts.kext where I adjusted USB-A 3.0 ports on the back plane to be 5GB only. USB 2.0 devices will work only in one port that is marked BIOS. USB-C motherboard header works with 3.0 and 2.0 devices. Motherboard USB3.2 header has two ports, but I am using only one because my case has only one front panel USB 3.0 port. See pictures below for detailed port configuration.
