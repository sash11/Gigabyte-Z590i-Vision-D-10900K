## BIOS
- Press Del to enter the BIOS. Use latest available bios for this board which F5.
- Enable XMP Profile1.

## USB issue
Because XhciPortLimit kernel quirk no longer works on the latest Big Sur 11.3.x and above, we are left with 15 ports max. I have made a custom USBPorts.kext where I adjusted the ports in such a way, that bottom two USB ports would not work at all. Top four in a row would all work as USB 3.x, but only three of them would work as USB 2.0. See the pictures below. USB-C motherboard header works with 3.x and 2.0 devices. Motherboard USB3.2 header has two ports, but I am using only one because my case has only one front panel USB 3.0 port.
